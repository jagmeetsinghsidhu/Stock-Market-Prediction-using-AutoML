AutoML-Plan adopts a best-first search algorithm in order to identify good pipelines. A best-first search algorithm explores an implicitly given graph by assigning a number to each node and choosing in each iteration the node with the currently best (usually lowest) known value for expansion. Expansion means computing all successors of a node. The graph description consists of the root node, the successor computation function used for the expansion, and a predicate over the nodes that tells whether a node is a goal node. The task is to predict the best stock price by automated hyperparameter tuned using AutoML from the root to a goal node with a minimum score, and a best-first algorithm tries to find such a path by expanding the intermediate nodes with minimum scores.
